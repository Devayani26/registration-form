**Registration Form using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB**

This repository contains the code for a user registration form developed as part of my full-stack web development internship at Bharat Intern. The registration form allows users to sign up and store their information securely in a MongoDB database.

**Features:**

- HTML/CSS frontend for a user-friendly registration form interface.
- Node.js backend for handling form submission and database operations.
- MongoDB database integration for storing user information.
- Input validation to ensure data integrity and security.
- Secure password hashing to protect user credentials.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your MongoDB database and configure the connection in the Node.js backend.
4. Start the server using `node app.js`.
5. Access the registration form through your browser and sign up with your information.
